Low Poly RPG Weapons Pack
Pack Creator: Ventuar
v1.0.6
------------------------------------------------
To use: Drag and drop prefabs from Prefabs folder into scene and assemble to fit your needs.

Tip: To achieve intended graphical results, switch Color Space (Project Settings > Player > Other Settings) from Gamma 
to Linear.

Note: Package was made and assembled in Unity's built-in render pipeline. HDRP currently not supported. Materials require conversion when 
importing into URP (Edit > Render Pipeline > Universal Render Pipeline > Upgrade Project Materials to UniversalRP Materials). Media images 
and screenshots were built and rendered in Blender. Email me if you have any questions!

If you enjoy the assets, make sure to leave a review! It's greatly appreciated, and goes a long way in helping the pack reach others.
